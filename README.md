Advanced Adaptive Traffic Signal Control System Using Gradient Boosting Regression Model

Developed an advanced adaptive traffic signal control system to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion at intersections. The system utilizes a Gradient Boosting Regression model to predict traffic density and adjust signal timings dynamically thus increasing overall throughput and reducing waiting time at intersections.
